                                       **💼 Internship Task 5 — Bank Account Simulation**
This is a Java-based CLI (Command Line Interface) project developed as part of Task 5 under the Elevate Labs Internship Program.

It simulates basic bank operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and it's also included MySql Database.
All operations like deposit, withdraw, view balance, and transaction history are implemented in a modular, layered architecture.
**🛠 Technologies Used**
Java (OOP Concepts),MySqlDatabase
Eclipse
Terminal (Command Line Interface)
